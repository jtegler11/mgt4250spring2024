## Project Description
### Questions of Interest
- Q1: What is the legal status of sports betting of each state in the United States?
- Q2: How much revenue has each state generated in the past year from sports betting?
- Q3: What is the estimated population of sports bettors in each state, and what markets or age groups are of interest?

  ### Important Statement
  These questions are *especially* **important** because
  1. Sports betting is a recent revelation in the United States, with New Jersey being the first state to legalize it in 2018, and it is up to the discretion of the state as to whether or not htey would legalize sports betting.
  2. Reason 2
  3. Reason 3
